### SKU:U178 & U187

Contains M5Stack-**Unit Synth & Unit MIDI** related case programs.

**Synth Unit** is an audio module designed for MIDI sound systems, featuring the SAM2695 audio synthesizer and NS4150B Class D amplifier chip. It accepts standard MIDI signals via serial communication, providing capabilities such as audio synthesis, mixing, sound effects processing, multi-channel instrument sound output, and parameter adjustments like four-stage EQ and reverb, enabling precise audio timbre and spatial perception adjustments to create rich musical effects.

**MIDI Unit** is a channel control and audio synthesis unit based on the MIDI interface. The switch on the front of the product allows you to set the left/right MIDI port's bypass mode. In Bypass mode, the left and right ports are directly connected; in Separate mode, the left and right ports are separated. The left and right MIDI ports support both standard 5-pin DIN and 3.5mm headphone interfaces. The TXD pin on the Grove port is connected to the left MIDI port signal, and the RXD pin on the Grove port is connected to the internal audio synthesizer's SAM2695 digital input. This allows an external M5 host to monitor or output MIDI signals through the Grove interface while simultaneously outputting synthesized audio. The audio signal is output through a 3.5mm headphone jack. This product is suitable for electronic music creation and production, live music control, and interactive music installations.
